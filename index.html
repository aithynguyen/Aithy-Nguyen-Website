        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Aithy Nguyen. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California Riverside in the progress of earning a Bachelor’s degree in English in order to graduate and become an educator for the subject of English. Some skills that will be needed for the position I am striving for include good communication skills as well as eagerness in the workplace. Although I have yet to gain experience as an english educator, I have had the pleasure of developing skills needed for the position during my years in schooling. <br><br>

       In highschool, I was a part of a club called Kiwins that organized many events for us students to volunteer and contribute our services. One even in particular I would like to mention is the Orange County Vegan Fest, in which I attended and was given the position of customer directory. I was required to answer any inquiries that customers had as well as keep up the energy as I would be doing the job for hours on end. This position allowed me to learn how to handle situations in which having clear and precise communication was key and also to efficiently talk to people of different backgrounds. I also was able to attend a poetry slam for my other club: Creative Writing Club and did similar things. I was put at a booth and was supposed to sell books and promote our club and our school. The position was stressful as one can imagine as I had to come up with constant phrases and new ideas about how my school and its creative writing program was unique and worth trying out. I was exceptionally proud of myself when our books sold count exceeded our expectations and walked out with high spirits. A more hands on in the classroom setting I was put in was when I volunteered for my church: St. Barbara Catholic Church to become a teacher’s assistant. I had never been an assistant before so I didn’t know what to expect when entering the position. However, upon starting, I quickly realized that the job was quite interesting. I think this is the point where I realized I wanted to become an educator because I liked to teach, to mentor, to help. I was able to help students with their work as well as help the teacher teach what needed to be taught. I saw that a teacher’s job was well needed, and I wanted to contribute to that need while doing something that makes me happy. Even though these positions I was in were not work related, they helped me develop skills and helped me grow as an individual so that when I do graduate college and enter the workspace, I will be able to apply what I know into what I do. And who knows, maybe if I end up changing my career path, I would still go into the field I want to go into with this knowledge that will help me in some other ways.
